CSS Sprites Generator Done Right. SmartSprites maintains CSS sprites in your designs, fully automatically. No tedious copying and pasting to your CSS when adding or changing sprite images.

Supported Fork
--------------

This fork has taken over work of supporting this software.

Heads up, discontinued software from original author!
-----------------------------------------------------

Since the modern web does not rely on small bitmaps any more, SmartSprites becomes irrelevant. We're not planning any new releases, but feel free to fork and use the code if you find it useful.

This fork is in fact alive still in case of needing it since I support the maven plugin I felt it smartsprites to continue for now as there are users of this still.

Quick start
-----------

1. Download SmartSprites binaries

2. Run:

       smartsprites --root-dir-path test/real-world-example

3. Look in +test/real-world-example+ for the results.

Maven plugin
