     * %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     * %
     * %  Realism in computer graphics typically requires using 24 bits/pixel to
     * %  generate an image. Yet many graphic display devices do not contain
     * %  the amount of memory necessary to match the spatial and color
     * %  resolution of the human eye. The QUANTIZE program takes a 24 bit
     * %  image and reduces the number of colors so it can be displayed on
     * %  raster device with less bits per pixel. In most instances, the
     * %  quantized image closely resembles the original reference image.
     * %
     * %  A reduction of colors in an image is also desirable for image
     * %  transmission and real-time animation.
     * %
     * %  Function Quantize takes a standard RGB or monochrome images and quantizes
     * %  them down to some fixed number of colors.
     * %
     * %  For purposes of color allocation, an image is a set of n pixels, where
     * %  each pixel is a point in RGB space. RGB space is a 3-dimensional
     * %  vector space, and each pixel, pi, is defined by an ordered triple of
     * %  red, green, and blue coordinates, (ri, gi, bi).
     * %
     * %  Each primary color component (red, green, or blue) represents an
     * %  intensity which varies linearly from 0 to a maximum value, cmax, which
     * %  corresponds to full saturation of that color. Color allocation is
     * %  defined over a domain consisting of the cube in RGB space with
     * %  opposite vertices at (0,0,0) and (cmax,cmax,cmax). QUANTIZE requires
     * %  cmax = 255.
     * %
     * %  The algorithm maps this domain onto a tree in which each node
     * %  represents a cube within that domain. In the following discussion
     * %  these cubes are defined by the coordinate of two opposite vertices:
     * %  The vertex nearest the origin in RGB space and the vertex farthest
     * %  from the origin.
     * %
     * %  The tree's root node represents the the entire domain, (0,0,0) through
     * %  (cmax,cmax,cmax). Each lower level in the tree is generated by
     * %  subdividing one node's cube into eight smaller cubes of equal size.
     * %  This corresponds to bisecting the parent cube with planes passing
     * %  through the midpoints of each edge.
     * %
     * %  The basic algorithm operates in three phases: Classification,
     * %  Reduction, and Assignment. Classification builds a color
     * %  description tree for the image. Reduction collapses the tree until
     * %  the number it represents, at most, the number of colors desired in the
     * %  output image. Assignment defines the output image's color map and
     * %  sets each pixel's color by reclassification in the reduced tree.
     * %  Our goal is to minimize the numerical discrepancies between the original
     * %  colors and quantized colors (quantization error).
     * %
     * %  Classification begins by initializing a color description tree of
     * %  sufficient depth to represent each possible input color in a leaf.
     * %  However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color
     * %  description tree in the classification phase for realistic values of
     * %  cmax. If colors components in the input image are quantized to k-bit
     * %  precision, so that cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the
     * %  root node to allow representing each possible input color in a leaf.
     * %  This becomes prohibitive because the tree's total number of nodes is
     * %  1 + sum(i=1,k,8k).
     * %
     * %  A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, cmax = 255.
     * %  Therefore, to avoid building a fully populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1)
     * %  Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed;  (2)
     * %  Chooses a maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired
     * %  number of colors in the output image (currently log2(colormap size)).
     * %
     * %  For each pixel in the input image, classification scans downward from
     * %  the root of the color description tree. At each level of the tree it
     * %  identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space
     * %  containing the pixel's color. It updates the following data for each
     * %  such node:
     * %
     * %    n1: Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube
     * %    which this node represents;
     * %
     * %    n2: Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at
     * %    lower depth in the tree;  initially,  n2 = 0 for all nodes except
     * %    leaves of the tree.
     * %
     * %    Sr, Sg, Sb: Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for
     * %    all pixels not classified at a lower depth. The combination of
     * %    these sums and n2  will ultimately characterize the mean color of a
     * %    set of pixels represented by this node.
     * %
     * %    E: The distance squared in RGB space between each pixel contained
     * %    within a node and the nodes' center. This represents the quantization
     * %    error for a node.
     * %
     * %  Reduction repeatedly prunes the tree until the number of nodes with
     * %  n2 &gt; 0 is less than or equal to the maximum number of colors allowed
     * %  in the output image. On any given iteration over the tree, it selects
     * %  those nodes whose E count is minimal for pruning and merges their
     * %  color statistics upward. It uses a pruning threshold, Ep, to govern
     * %  node selection as follows:
     * %
     * %    Ep = 0
     * %    while number of nodes with (n2 &gt; 0) &gt; required maximum number of colors
     * %      prune all nodes such that E &lt;= Ep
     * %      Set Ep to minimum E in remaining nodes
     * %
     * %  This has the effect of minimizing any quantization error when merging
     * %  two nodes together.
     * %
     * %  When a node to be pruned has offspring, the pruning procedure invokes
     * %  itself recursively in order to prune the tree from the leaves upward.
     * %  n2,  Sr, Sg,  and  Sb in a node being pruned are always added to the
     * %  corresponding data in that node's parent. This retains the pruned
     * %  node's color characteristics for later averaging.
     * %
     * %  For each node, n2 pixels exist for which that node represents the
     * %  smallest volume in RGB space containing those pixel's colors. When n2
     * %  &gt; 0 the node will uniquely define a color in the output image. At the
     * %  beginning of reduction,  n2 = 0  for all nodes except a the leaves of
     * %  the tree which represent colors present in the input image.
     * %
     * %  The other pixel count, n1, indicates the total number of colors
     * %  within the cubic volume which the node represents. This includes n1 -
     * %  n2  pixels whose colors should be defined by nodes at a lower level in
     * %  the tree.
     * %
     * %  Assignment generates the output image from the pruned tree. The
     * %  output image consists of two parts: (1)  A color map, which is an
     * %  array of color descriptions (RGB triples) for each color present in
     * %  the output image;  (2)  A pixel array, which represents each pixel as
     * %  an index into the color map array.
     * %
     * %  First, the assignment phase makes one pass over the pruned color
     * %  description tree to establish the image's color map. For each node
     * %  with n2  &gt; 0, it divides Sr, Sg, and Sb by n2 . This produces the
     * %  mean color of all pixels that classify no lower than this node. Each
     * %  of these colors becomes an entry in the color map.
     * %
     * %  Finally,  the assignment phase reclassifies each pixel in the pruned
     * %  tree to identify the deepest node containing the pixel's color. The
     * %  pixel's value in the pixel array becomes the index of this node's mean
     * %  color in the color map.

         * Procedure Classification begins by initializing a color description tree of sufficient depth to represent
         * each possible input color in a leaf. However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color description
         * tree in the classification phase for realistic values of cmax. If colors components in the input image are
         * quantized to k-bit precision, so that cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the root node to allow
         * representing each possible input color in a leaf. This becomes prohibitive because the tree's total number of
         * nodes is 1 + sum(i=1,k,8k).
         * &lt;p&gt;
         * A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, cmax = 255. Therefore, to avoid building a fully
         * populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1) Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed; (2) Chooses a
         * maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired number of colors in the output image (currently
         * log2(colormap size)).
         * &lt;p&gt;
         * For each pixel in the input image, classification scans downward from the root of the color description tree.
         * At each level of the tree it identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space containing It
         * updates the following data for each such node:
         * &lt;p&gt;
         * number_pixels : Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube which this node represents;
         * &lt;p&gt;
         * unique : Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at lower depth in the tree; initially, n2
         * = 0 for all nodes except leaves of the tree.
         * &lt;p&gt;
         * total_red/green/blue : Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for all pixels not classified at a
         * lower depth. The combination of these sums and n2 will ultimately characterize the mean color of a set of
         * pixels represented by this node.
